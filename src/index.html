    <h1>The Guide Just For You</h1>
    <section>

      <p>I often wonder why, at such a young age in grade 9, I was expected to make the critical decision of choosing subjects when I had no clear idea of what I wanted to pursue or the long-term impact those choices would have on my life. As a child, I dreamed of becoming a surgeon, specifically a heart transplant surgeon, and later, I aspired to be a lawyer. I never felt a strong connection to science-related subjects, so I knew I wouldn’t choose the sciences stream. Since I wanted to be a lawyer, therefore, I thought I should select business management and economics and perhaps add history.</p>
      <p>When the time came to choose our subjects, I sought advice from my friends. They had opted for accounting, business management, and economics, which formed the commerce stream. Can you guess which subjects I chose? The same ones, of course. Why did I not follow my plan you may ask? I chose the commerce stream because all my friends did, and I didn’t want to be the only one in a history class. I believed that together, we would help each other navigate the next three years, especially since they were good at accounting.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, I regret that decision. It’s clear how confused I was, shifting from wanting to be a surgeon to a lawyer, only to choose commerce subjects based on what my friends had selected.</p>
      <p>By the end of grade 10, all my friends had failed. One became pregnant and took a break from school, while the other two had to repeat the year. I was left alone with a subject I disliked, which led to poor performance due to my negative mindset and misplaced reliance on my friends to help me excel. Unfortunately, life had a different plan for me, and I was left to face this challenge on my own. It was difficult; I barely managed to pass with the required marks, and this caused me significant anxiety. I worried about how I would gain university admission with such mediocre marks. Lacking sufficient knowledge about the variety of courses available at universities, I mistakenly believed that since I was studying commerce, I was limited to applying for commerce-related courses only.</p>
      <p>You might wonder why I didn’t switch from accounting to history once my friends were no longer around to help. Quitting was not an option, especially since one of my teachers advised me that sticking with accounting would increase my chances of getting into a university; she wasn’t entirely right, but I respected and trusted her judgment. So, I continued with accounting, attending every extra class available and befriending one of the top students in my class so we could study together. She shared her study techniques, and I consulted my teacher daily to show my commitment and seek help with my struggles.</p>
      <p>What did I end up studying? What profession am I in? And do I love what I do?</p>
      <p>I studied a BA in Information Management, a course I hadn’t even known existed, to be honest. I went through the late registration process due to my confusion about what I should apply for since I knew I didn’t want to study accounting. I called the enrollment center and asked which courses were still available. A kind lady listed all the options, and when she mentioned BA Information Management, it caught my attention. Without hesitation, I shouted, ‘Yes! I’ll take that course.’ I ended up enjoying it so much which led me to pursue a BCom Honours degree.</p>
      <p>My career journey has not been linear. I started working as a Christmas casual at Cotton On during the December school holidays and did a lot of promotional work. During my third year, I joined a one-year IT & Financial Shared Services learnership at Standard Bank. Many people didn’t understand why I chose a learnership despite having a degree. I struggled to find the words to explain why I opted for a learnership over other higher-paying opportunities. However, a part of me knew that this learnership would open doors for me, and I’m glad I trusted my instincts.</p>
      <p>Once my learnership was completed, I joined Hitachi Vantara as a marketing intern. Then, an opportunity that changed my life came my way—I was selected to join the Standard Bank IT graduate program, class of 2020.</p>
      <p>The graduate program allowed me to explore several roles, including software development, cloud engineering, and Scrum Master. I was a software development graduate for only two weeks before I requested to be moved to a different department because I knew I wouldn’t thrive in the team I was placed in. I had to be vulnerable with my HR manager and ask him to move me into a different role. He gave me the opportunity to interview two people from different teams, one a cloud engineer/scrum master and the other a user experience designer. Interviewing them helped me fully understand what each role would require from me and the skills I would develop. After further research, I decided to join the cloud team. A few months into the role as a cloud engineer, I asked for a stretch role as a Scrum Master. These two roles helped me learn a great deal from my team and the projects we worked on.</p>
      <p>Two years later, in 2022, I joined my current organization. I am now a Cloud Solutions Architect at Microsoft, focusing on Microsoft Azure infrastructure.</p>
      <p>To students in grade 8 and 9, I offer this advice: spend your time reading and researching different career paths and the subjects required for university entry. Interview people you admire, teachers, family members, your friends’ parents—and attend career days.</p>
